# Coding-Train-p5.js-Course-Progress
Learning p5.js with [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and documenting my progress/code along the way. I'm a noob so if there are issues with anything I'd appreciate feedback.

**1. SHAPES & DRAWING EXERCISE**

Here is my response to the prompt at the end of [1.3: Shapes & Drawing - p5.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3TeLi6Ns1E).
* Make your own picture and only use the 2D Primitives
* I added my own constraint - Use only two of each primitive

**2. FIGURING OUT ARCS**

I'm a visual learner so being able to see a variety of arcs and having them for reference in the future sounded helpful. The [arc reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/arc) helps a bit but after reading it I'm still not 100% on how these things work. Hell, after making this I'm still not 100% on it. But making this helped a little.
